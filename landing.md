			<h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
		</header>
		<p>A Bay Area native, Matt got his Bachelors degree in Advertising with an emphasis in Anthropology and a certificate in Technology Arts and Media from the University of Colorado Boulder in 2017. After a brief stint working as a strategist in a few Boulder advertising agencies, Matt went back to CU and got a masters degree in Strategic Communication Design where he focused on Critical Making and Product Design. He is passionate about making a positive difference in the world wherever possible, and specializes in connecting people with complimentary knowledge and skills. He enjoys writing about himself in third person because it makes him feel accomplished and slightly more credible. Here are some things he does./p>

					<h3>The Generation Exchange</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I started the Generation Exchange, an ongoing project where graduate students and older adults exchange knowledge and perspectives about technology. Student volunteers are paired one-on-one with an older adult who is looking for answers to basic questions about their phones, laptops, and tablets. As the student “tech natives” exchange guidance on the technologies with which they’ve grown up, they benefit from the seasoned perspectives, invaluable wisdom, and professional connections of their older counterparts.</p>
