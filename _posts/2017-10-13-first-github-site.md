It is finally time to make my website. I decided to host my website on GitHub pages and apply a Jekyll theme to it.

Goals

1. Host my site using GitHub Pages
2. Apply a theme
3. Learn to Use Atom/Github/Jekyll
4. Update my site using `git clone` `git add` `git push` and `git commit`

## 1. Making a Github page

GitHub offers every user one free hosted page which awesome because it is free and easy to update. The first thing I did was create a new repository on Github. The repository must be "yourname.github.io".
