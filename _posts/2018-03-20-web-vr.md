## What

I compiled some of my favorite places on the planet into 360 degree photos that can be viewed in VR from a web browser. The photos are accessible by any VR platform (Vive, Cardboard, Oculus, etc).

## Why

In three weeks, [The GenerationExchange](thegenerationexchange.net) will hosting a workshop for seniors and technology at our studio. While the focus will be mainly on the basics, I want show off some of the other awesome things we have access to in the studio like the vinyl cutter, 3D printer, and VR. I will use this site to show how easy it is to make VR accessible through web and viewable on phones.

## How

To create find the images I turned to Google maps and began exploring the globe. I used a program called [Street View Download 360](https://istreetview.com) to take 360 degree photos of some awesome places I found.

Once I had the photos I made a page to host them. I made each photo its own page, and an index.html page to navigate between them.

The code for each individual page looked like this.

```
<a-scene>
    <a-sky src="stonehenge2.jpg" rotation="0 -130 0"></a-sky>
    <a-text font="kelsonsans" value="Stonehenge" width="6" position="-2.5 0.25 -1.5"
                rotation="0 15 0"></a-text>
</a-scene>
```

The 360 degree image is placed in the scene's `<sky>` tag. That creates the environment for users to look around the image captured from Google Earth.

All of the pages are linked to the home page. On there, I simply used `<iframe>` to create links to each page. All of the pages are viewable in that page. The code:

```
<div id="container">
  <h1>Planet Earth is Awesome </h1>
  <h2>Volcano in Vanuatu</h2>
    <iframe src="Volcano.html" allowfullscreen="yes" allowvr="yes"></iframe>
  <h2>Stonehenge</h2>
    <iframe src="stonehenge.html" allowfullscreen="yes" allowvr="yes"></iframe>
  <h2>Penguins in Antartica</h2>
    <iframe src="penguins.html" allowfullscreen="yes" allowvr="yes"></iframe>
  <h2>Mt. Everest</h2>
    <iframe src="everest.html" allowfullscreen="yes" allowvr="yes"></iframe>
  <h2>The Great Barrier Reef</h2>
    <iframe src="deepsea.html" allowfullscreen="yes" allowvr="yes"></iframe>
</div>
```
