I decided to make a cup in Rhino.

*Reason: I need more cups for my apartment*.

I figured the easiest way to go about this would be to use the Curve tool and the Revolve tool. Here is a brief step by step of what I did.

1. Open Rhino
2. Use the curve tool starting at 0 to draw the outline of the cup from the front perspective. Use return to set points and shift to make curves.
3. To even out the points on the lip of the glass I used the "SetPt" tool, and then joined all the lines together using the "Join" command.
4. Use the "Blend" command to join the two lines and make the lip at the top of the glass.
5. Once all the the lines were connected and aligned properly I used the "Revolve" command starting at 0 to make a 360 degree extrusion of the shape.
6. That's it! Here is a screen capture of this process in action.

*Disclaimer: When I opened the file in Cura (the software for our printer) it notified my that my cup would take 21 hours to print. I decided not to hog the printer for that long so I scaled my cup down to the dimensions of a shot glass ;)*

Success!

**What I learned**

- Anything is possible with a combination of CAD and a printer.

Although simple, I was very excited to see how well my shot glass turned out. Can't wait to get better at Rhino and start making more things with the printer.

**Next Up**

I want to make a drone using a 3D printer and connect it to a VR headset.
