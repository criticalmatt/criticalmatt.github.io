# Final Project - Smart Nozzle

I am from California born and raised, and since I was young my mother has always had a beautiful garden. During the drought, she was forced to downsize the garden in order to conserve water. The drought is now over, and my Mom's garden is back and booming. She has over 40 plants.

While I was home for the summer I observed my mom water her plants. Every afternoon she takes the hose and walks around to each plant and waters them *individually*. The whole process takes about at least an hour.

I have killed plants before by overwatering.  Turns out I'm not the only one. Lots of people over water their plants simply due to lack of knowledge of the plants or by forgetting the last time they watered them.

Some Google searches about overwatering quickly led me to find that [too much water is as harmful to plants as not enough](http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/home/ct-sun-0726-garden-morton-20150720-story.html). Again, this is probably the first thing they teach you in Plants 101, but I was thoroughly unaware that overwatering was a thing.

I was curious how she determines the right amount of water to give each plant. She bluntly responded that the process is fairly arbitrary. I want to design a **smart nozzle** that will create a more efficient way for my mom to water her plants, specifically addressing three needs.

1. Variable watering. She wants to water some plants more and some plants less, depending on the drought tolerance of the plant.
2. Prevent killing plants via over-watering or under-watering.
3. Stop wasting water in drought situations.

Here are the behaviors I observed while watching her water her plants in the garden.

- she waters each plant individually.
  - same amount of time, same amount of water.
- while watering plants that are in the ground, she tends to hold the hose over the each plant for about 2-3 minutes (again this number is arbitrary)
- she waters plants in pots until water starts to leak from the bottom.
  - this tells me she is looks for a visual cue to know when to stop watering.

## Sketch

  I thought it would be cool to make a nozzle that can has different settings based on the type of plant she wants to water. The nozzle will know how much water the plant needs, water the plant until that amount has been reached, and then turn off automatically, allowing my mom to move on to the next plant.

  This would maximize efficiency for my mom because she wouldn't have to worry about how long she's watering each plant, while also making sure the plant gets the perfect amount of water, and minimizing the waste of excess watering.

  Here is my first sketch of what this would look like.

  I can see many more uses for something like this. I imagine an app that would accompany the nozzle where users could input every plant in their garden and upload it to the hose.
